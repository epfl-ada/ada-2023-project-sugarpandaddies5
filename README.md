# From Damsels to Dialogue: A Critical Examination of the Bechdel Test and Female Representation in Cinema
## Abstract
Cinema is an art reflecting society and therefore, lays bare its inequalities, particularly concerning the portrayal of women on screen. The [Bechdel Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bechdel_test) provides a simple criterion to assess this representation in films and works of fiction. It highlights the underrepresentation of women, often relegated to secondary roles or romantic interests when they do appear in movies. The test has three criteria that a film must meet to pass: 
- It must have at least two named female characters. 
- These characters must have a conversation with each other. 
- The conversation must be about something other than a man 

Although this test appears like a bare minimum, [less than half](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2022-95091-001.html) of noteworthy films from the past 40 years have passed. Using the CMU Movie Corpus we will proceed with a critical analysis of the Bechdel test and what it truly says about female representation in cinema. 

## Research Questions
- Does the country of production and/or the genre of the film impact the likelihood of passing the Bechdel test ?
- Does the result of the test impact box office success ?
- How has the proportion of films that pass the Bechdel test changed over time ?
- What is the impact of the quantity of female characters on the result of the test ?
- Can films that uphold misogynistic character tropes still pass the test ?
- What is the relationship between actress age, character age, and the test ?
- Can we accurately predict the result of the test based only on information contained in the MCU Movie Corpus ?

## Additional Datasets
- Bechdel Test results : dataset containing a pass/fail marker for 1795 films, as well as budget information.
- CPI per country : dataset giving inflation information for a range of countries. It is important to adjust box office revenue for inflation, especially considering that certain movies studied were produced over 100 years ago when money had a very different value.

## Methods
### Part 1 : Data clean up and pre-processing
### Part 2 : General analysis 
### Part 3 : Critical study of the Bechdel test
### Part 4 : Prediction and determination of confounding factors
